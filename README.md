# RelationAlgebraGames
 
This is part of a research project exploring representability of relation algebras through reinforcement learning. What I have done so far:

randomRA.py - randomly generates a relation algebra. Can pick properties to fix such as number of units, number of diversity atoms, etc
relalg.py - contains the relation algebra class, used by almost all the python programs
random_gen_test.py - contains some tests for the random relation algebra generator
datacollection.py - a python script to find some estimates on the proportion of associative algebras of various sizes
game_player.py - an implementation of the representation game
training.py - (to be completed) where models are trained to play the representation game
