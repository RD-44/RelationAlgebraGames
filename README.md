# RelationAlgebraGames
 
This is part of a research project exploring representability of relation algebras through reinforcement learning. What's in each folder:

ai - used for the logic powering the computer players in the game
data - used to collect data on associative vs non associative algebras
ras - contains the RA class (used to create relation algebras) and the random ra generator
game - all code to run the representation game between two players
